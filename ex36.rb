# The first step would be to turn on your coomputer


# Activate your preferred text editor via terminal hehe


# Create a new file and open it in your preferred text editor


# If 'touch test.txt' was typed in terminal then it is correct


# Then open test.txt with your preferred text editor with:  <application> test.txt


# Press Y or N to finish writing file which will save or close it


# Then open back up terminal


# Prompt the user to ask what is a way of uploading to github via terminal?


# First step, change directory to file, example could be `cd ~/desktop/test.txt'


# Question user with three options, A being do git status or B, git add <filename>.txt or C, git branch ???
# Use a conditional statement


# If A then go to check branch, if B 'try again', if C 'try again'
# Possibly hint at user the solution if failed to many times? (challenge)


# After adding ask user the proper syntax for committing, else prompt user to do research on how to do so at
# the actual URL of Github docs


# When everything is correct git push


# Once that is done prompt user with a completion
